# Reflection-on-feedback

**Reflection on my writing process and experience of receiving feedback from my peers**

This exercise or assignment about finding an entry and writing a synopsis, has been helpful by making me start to think about the final paper, and which topics from the course I find most interesting and what I would like to examine in my final paper.
To read and give feedback on my study-groups synopsizes has been rewarding as well. By reading their synopsis you get to see how they have interpreted the assignment, and how they solved the task. Thereby you also get inspiration, for example I got inspired by their way of initiating their synopsis, written as an initiation of the final paper, addressing the entry for investigation and explaining the reason and importance of this examination. Also, how they had already made a disposition on how to build up their finial paper and how some of them already had made comments on which perspectives the different texts take on their topic or entry.  

Receiving feedback from my peers has been helpful regarding specifying my final paper. I have both got something out of the positive and constructive critique. The positive critique about my choice of entry and the problem I want to examine, made me decide to stick with my chosen entry.
It also seems to come through for this assignment that my writing strength is to organize â€“ which I have done in this synopsis by skimming the texts and asses which texts would be able to answer which questions.

Regarding feedback I received through my peer response, I found it very useful to get critique on my questions for examinations and the proposal to make a disposition on how I would like to write and build up my paper. Therefore, in terms of my writing, I would like to further specify my questions for examination, and make them more coherent, so that they create a red thread, where I can use the disclosure to the analysis part and those two parts to discuss my entry. 
I also think it would be very helpful to make a disposition for my final paper to create an overview of the final paper, which might help getting started and create this red thread. 

Through this project I have learned/realized that to find out which entry to choose for your final paper, you need to look trough all of the possibilities and look for pros and cons, and thereby take a feeling on which one of them feels most interesting, but also which entry you can find literature and materials about. I have also realized the importance of finding the right questions to examine and that they need to have a connection, so they make sense through the whole final paper.
